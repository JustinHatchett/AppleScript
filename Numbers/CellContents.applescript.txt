My solution is to tell Applescript to press "Command + N", which is the shortkey for "Start a new conversation"

activate application "Messages"
   tell application "System Events" to tell process "Messages"
   key code 45 using command down           -- press Command + N to start a new window
   keystroke "<replace with phone number>"  -- input the phone number
   key code 36                              -- press Enter to focus on the message area
   keystroke "<replace with message>"       -- type some message
   key code 36                              -- press Enter to send
end tell
This script will start a new conversation and send the message to the phone number through iMessage
